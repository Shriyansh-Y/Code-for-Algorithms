Problem Statement: 
All pairs shortest paths

Problem Definition:
In this problem, we will be dealing with a graph, that's defined by a collection of words, each word representing a vertex.
Words consist of lower-case letters, and there's an edge between two words if the they have the same length and differ at 
just one character position. The weight of the edge is how far apart the differing letters are in alphabetic order. 
Example, the words "help" and "yelp" would be connected by an edge of weight 17 (since 'y' is 17 characters away from 'h' 
in the alphabet). There wouldn't be an edge between "ram" and "arm"; although they contain the same letters, they differ 
in the first character position and in the second.

The program will read a list of words and compute the shortest path matrix. A simple statistic based on the matrix computed as follows:
For each word, w, compute the number of other words one can reach starting from wi and traversing edges of the graph. 
Computing the average number of reachable words, averaged over all words in the list, we get this value (rounded to two fractional digits).

The program will respond to a sequence of queries. Each querry will give a pair of words from the list. In response, the program 
will print out the length of the shortest path from the first word to the second one, followed by the sequence of words on one 
such shortest path. If there isn't a path, it will print the two words, followed by "not reachable". 

The shortest path is discovered by using a recursive function print_shortest_path() thereby implementing a linear time technique instead.

Implementation:
The input file starts with a positive integer n (stored in number_of_words), giving the number of words on the list. 
It be followed by n words, one per line. Words will consist only of lower-case letters, but they may be of different lengths.
The word list is followed by a non-negative integer, m, stored in number_of_queries giving the number of queries. This will be followed 
by m lines, each line containing two words from the list.

Functions (methods) used:
1. compare(): Used to compare if the input doesn't contain words of different lengths.
2. calculate_weight(): Used to calculate the edge weight i.e. the value equal to the difference
					   between the two words differing in one letter at one position only.
3. display(): Displays the required output.
4. print_shortest_path(): Prints the shortest path recursively.
